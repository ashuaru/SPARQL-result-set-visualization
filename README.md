# SPARQL-result-set-visualization
VizResu is a web-based service for the visualization of linked data retrieved by a public SPARQL endpoint.
A specific scholarly knowledge graph is considered as a use case for analyzing metadata of renowned scientific events in eight computer science sub-domains.
% In this paper we propose a semi-automatic approach that generates various charts from SPARQL queries over data represented as RDF graphs,
% We use a scholarly data knowledge graph, i.e., EVENTSKG, as a case study in this work.
A decision tree classifier is used to automatically detect the type of the produced charts based of the type of the results returned by the SPARQL endpoint.
VizResu is designed to support semantic data analysis by visualizing the results of predefined query templates using an asynchronous web application.
